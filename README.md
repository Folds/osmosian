Plain English Programming:  the CAL compiler, editor, writer, and desktop.

CAL-3040 is a working product of the Osmosian Order's
philosophy of making programming simpler.
The Osmosian Order has improved the language and compiler
from version 3040.  Version 4700 was released in January 2017.
If you want to participate in the future development of CAL,
please contact the Osmosian Order at www.osmosian.com .

If you want to program in Plain English in an environment that supports
sharing the desktop, scrollbars, mouse-wheel scrolling, font menus,
command-line options,  and automated testing, please visit https://github.com/Folds/english . 
That project is based on a fork of the CAL-3040 code;
it is **not** endorsed by the Osmosian Order.
