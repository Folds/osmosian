Plain English Programming:  the CAL compiler, editor, writer, and desktop.

CAL-3040 is a working product of the Osmosian Order's
philosophy of making programming simpler.
Future development of CAL will be based on version 3040,
not the version 3043 that is in the "development" branch on GitHub.
If you want to participate in the future development of CAL,
please contact the Osmosian Order at www.osmosian.com .

If you want to explore the concept of English-language programming
outside the CAL environment, please visit
