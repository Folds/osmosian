Plain English Programming:  the CAL compiler, editor, writer, and desktop.

CAL-3040 is a working product of the Osmosian Order's
philosophy of making programming simpler.
The Osmosian Order has improved the language and compiler
from version 3040.  Version 4700 was released in January 2017.
If you want to participate in the future development of CAL,
please contact the Osmosian Order at www.osmosian.com .

The version 3075 that is in the "development" branch on GitHub
uses the 3000-series language and compiler.  
CAL-3075 has major updates to the IDE:
- It can share the screen.
- The writer and editor have menu items for changing fonts (at the text block level).
- The editor has a scrollbar, and supports mouse-wheel scrolling.
- It has a built-in test framework.

CAL-3075 also has command line options:
- /left, /right, or neither to start in a half-screen mode or the full-screen mode.
- /tt tells the editor to use a fixed-width font (Courier New).
- /folder set the tabs' default folder.
- /files sets tab(s)' starting file(s).
- /runfolder and /runfiles propagate /folder and /files to programs that are compiled and run.
- /compile compiles a .exe file, and quits.
- /list compiles a .exe file, lists the corresponding .lst file, and quits.
- /test runs the automated tests, and quits.
